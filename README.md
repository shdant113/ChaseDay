## User Stories

#### Upon visiting the site:
The user does not have to be logged in to visit the site. If they are not logged in and visit the home page/dashboard, they will see a stream of the newest posts, which will consist of a thumbnail chosen by the poster and the first 4-6 lines of the log (trailing off with a "read more" button). They can view each of those posts and follow the route to the poster's profile. They will not be able to rate/like a post or comment. Any user, whether logged in or not, can share a log that they like to their Facebook or Twitter account by using the share buttons in each log component.

If they are logged in, the dashboard will by default be populated with the newest posts. However, a user can also follow whoever they like. Upon following a user, the user's posts within the last 7 days will automatically appear before other posts on their dashboard. They will be able to rate and comment on any posts by opening the post component, which will show the entire log with photos and embedded videos with a direct link to the poster's full log profile at the top. They will also be able to share to their Facebook or Twitter accounts.

#### Creating a Log:
A logged in user can create a log of their chase day, which once posted will be created at the top of their profile. The user will be able to choose from a selection of styles (fonts, bold/italics, sizes, etc) to write their log. The user should be able to upload image attachments with their log, which should appear within their post when they attach it instead of simply at the end of the post. The user can will also be able to either attach a video file or embed a video from Youtube/Facebook/etc, depending on storage space and general feasibility. When the user submits a post, it will appear as the most recent result on their profile as well as the dashboard.

A user can edit or delete anything in their logs at any time. If they delete a post, it will destroy all ratings on that post. However, deleting a post will not affect their total ratings displayed on their profile.

#### Editing Profile:
A logged in user will have a user profile where all of their logs will be displayed. The user can upload a cover and profile photo, which will both be restricted in size to fit within the template. They can also write their bio and post their location and chase experience as well as link to social media accounts, and website.

#### Stretch Goal - Messaging:
Users should be able to send one another messages as well as message within a group. This message system should be dynamic like a chatroom, wherein messages appear and can be replied to by the recipient immediately upon being sent. 

#### Stretch Goal - Notifications:
Notifications for new messages as well as notifications for new posts by people a user has followed should likewise be dynamic and appear immediately. 

#### Stretch Goal - Administrative functionality:
An admin user should be able to edit the content of any log and erase any log. An admin should also be able to restrict the posting abilities of user accounts or ban them without erasing their content.

#### Stretch Goal - Embed maps:
Provide functionality for users to map where they were on an actual map in any given log.
